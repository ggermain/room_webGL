Room in webGL
--------------

This is just a simple webGL demo with the goal of creating a room with a few "windows" that we can inspect from all angles.  

###Libraries: 
   
  * three.js(from mr. doob)  
    * TrackballControls.js(plugin for three.js)    
  * ThreeCSG.js(written by chandlerprall for three.js. Made one change to the code to get it to work. Changed line 201, "setEulerFromRotationMatrix" to "setFromRotationMatrix".
